# Intersecting Ranges

PyRanges objects can be intersected with other PyRanges to find the subset of
the genome that is contained in both. The regular intersection-method finds the
intersection of all combinations of ranges: [^1]

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.load_dataset("aorta")
gr2 = pr.load_dataset("aorta2")
print(gr.intersection(gr2))
```

The set_intersection method clusters the intervals (i.e. merges them into one) before finding the intersection: [^2]

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(gr.set_intersection(gr2))
```

Both methods also take a strandedness option, which can either be `"same"`, `"opposite"` or `False`/`None`

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(gr.set_intersection(gr2, strandedness="opposite"))
```

[^1]: This is the same behavior as bedtools intersect.
[^2]: This is the same behavior as Bioconductor GenomicRanges intersect.

The intersection method also takes a how argument, which currently accepts the
option `"containment"`, which requires that the intervals in self be completely
within the intervals in other.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
f1 = pr.load_dataset("f1")
print(f1)
f2 = pr.load_dataset("f2")
print(f2)
result = f2.intersection(f1, how="containment")
print(result)
```
