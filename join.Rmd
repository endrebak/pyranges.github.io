# Joining Ranges

You can combine all the intervals that overlap in two PyRanges objects with the join method.
If you do not use a suffix, the default `_b` is chosen.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
import pyranges as pr
gr = pr.load_dataset("aorta")
gr2 = pr.load_dataset("aorta2")
print(gr.join(gr2, suffix="_2"))
```

Both methods also take a strandedness option, which can either be `"same"`, `"opposite"` or `False`/`None`

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(gr.join(gr2, strandedness="opposite"))
```

The join method also takes a how argument, which currently accepts the
option `"containment"`, which requires that the intervals in self be
completely within the intervals in other.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(f2.join(f1, how="containment"))
```

The join method also takes the argument new_pos which can either be `union`or
`Ã¬ntersection`. The default suffixes are `["_a", "_b"]`, but a suffixes argument
overrides this.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
print(f2.join(f1, new_pos="intersection"))
```
