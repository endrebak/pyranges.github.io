# An introduction to RLEs

Rles are runlengths - a datastructure that can compactly describe the coverage
of a genome (or some other score that is associated with each nucleotide). It is
used for efficient genomewide arithmetic operations on these scores.

```{python tidy=FALSE}
from pyrle import Rle # or: from pyranges import Rle

runs = [10, 10, 10, 10]
values = [0, 1, 0, 0]

r1 = Rle(runs, values)
print(r1)

runs2 = [11, 9, 20]
values2 = [100, 0, 100]

r2 = Rle(runs2, values2)
print(r2)

print(r1 + r2)

print(r1 * r2)

print(r1.runs)
print(r1.values)

r1 = r1 + 5
print(r1)

print(r2 / r1)
